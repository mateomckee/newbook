# Newbook

UTSA's first student-made course catalog website, made for the convenience of all UTSA students. Launched in April, 2024.

Newbook was developed by three UTSA computer science freshmen as a passion project to help other students in course registration and planning.
It is completely free to use, and open for other developers to reference.

[Update 2025]
The project has since been taken down and remade by other students as part of a senior design project.
